	//if we have 5(0101), it has 2 set bits so we will check if first bit is set or not and then discard the bit 
	//by moving it to the right. We will check if first bit is set or not by n/2.
	//We will continue this process till the number n becomes zero, if all bits become 000... then number becomes zero.
	//For every set bit we will increment our result.

	//More efficient soln using Brian Kerningham's algorithm
	//Instead of checking all the bits if set or not, we use the expression n = (n &(n-1))
	//When you subtract 1 from the number then then new number has bits set as 1 till the last/right-most set bit
	//and other bits set to zero after 1.
	//For ex : if n = 40 -> 101000, then 39 -> 100111, here you can see the bits till last set bit are 1s and and then 0s,
	//until the next set bit
	//So as per this algorithm, we will get in 1st iteration : 101000
	//														  &100111									
	//														   100000
	//In second iteration we get : 							  &011111
	//														   000000
	//At this point we will stop as number becomes zero. Time Complexity : O(number of set bits) and not total bits
