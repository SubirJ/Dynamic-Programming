		//***Note*** : When we say nth position below we start the bit position from 0 just like array index
		//So position 0 means first bit ie the LSB and position 1 means 2nd bit from right to left
		//for ex : 9 -> 1001 so position 0 is 1 and position 1 is 0 and position 2 is 0 and position 3 is again 1
		//From right to left
		
		//Set a bit at nth position in a number
		//we will set bit at position 2 of number 9 to make it 13
		//Just left shift "1" to n places and then mask it with given number(9 in our case) with "OR" operator
		//This will give us the required number
		System.out.println("Set bit at nth position : "+(n | (1 << 2)));

		//To unset a bit at nth position in a number
		//We will unset the bit at position 0 of number 9 to make it 8 -> 1000
		//First left shift 1 to n places (1 << n) and then we will invert the given bits to unset that shifted "1"

		//We will check for number 9(1001), whether bit at 3rd position is set or not, it should return number greater than 0

		//which is equivalent to division by 2.

		//We will calculate log2 of 9 and 64 with our method and also with java inbuilt functions
		//We do not have a direct function for calculating log2 in java but we have Math.log10 function

		//Flipping the bits of a number
		//It can be done by a simple way, just simply subtract the number from the value obtained 
		//when all the bits are equal to 1.
		//We will flip 23(10111) to get 8(01000), by subtracting it from when all the bits are 1
		//23 has 5 bits and when 5 bits are 1 we get 31(11111) so we subtract 23 from 31 to get 8
		//Similarly to flip 4(0100) , we consider it has 4 bits, and to flip it we need 4 bits of 1 which is 15(1111)
		//So after flipping 0100 we get 1011 which is 11, and we get 15-4 = 11

		//Unsigned right shift
		//The signed right shift (>>) will make positive number negative since java has 32-bit integers
		//it adds 1 as leading bits instead of 0
		//But the unsigned right shift(>>>) treats negative number as positive only by adding 0s as leading bits
		System.out.println("Right Shift(Signed) : "+(-2 >> 1)); //(Right shift -2 with any number of bits will always give -1 as result)
		System.out.println("Right Shift(Signed) : "+(-2 >>> 1)); //this will return a positive number
