/*
To check if a number is a power of 2 or not using Bit manipulation

formula : If we subtract 1 from a number which is a power of 2 then all of it's unset bits after the only set bit become set;
		  and the set bit become unset.
		  
		  For example, consider 4 ( Binary representation: 100) and 16(Binary representation: 10000), 
		  we get following after subtracting 1 from them:
		  
		  3 –> 011
		  15 –> 01111
		  
You can clearly see that bitwise-AND(&) of 4 and 3 gives zero, similarly 16 and 15 also gives zero.

So, if a number N is a power of 2 then bitwise-AND(&) of N and N-1 will be zero. 
We can say that N is a power of 2 or not based on the value of N&(N-1).

	//Method to check if a number is power of 2 or not
	//It works as, if number is a power of 2, suppose number 4 then we divide it continuosly by 2 until we get remainder as 1
	//For 4 we get, 4 -> 2 -> 1
	//For 6, if we divide by 2 then we get an odd number, but a power of 2 will not have divide by 2 output as odd unless 1
	//So it means its not power of 2 and we return false
